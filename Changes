Release history for Gentoo-PerlMod-Version

{{$NEXT}}
        Switch to @Author::KENTNL bundle.

        Don't strip excess 0 groups. 
        Use standard 'normalized' dotted-decimal versions (without leading 'v' and with at least 3 components)
        ( Thanks to Torsten Veller )

0.2.2     2011-01-12 03:20:34 Pacific/Auckland

        Added POD to the script to be helpful.

        Removed a few errors from the POD.

        Hack it so lax version doesn't influence the whole parse, instead,
             laxing is only applied when its deemed the input isn't within a
             defined format.

        Dropped _has_bad_bits in favour of individual targeted regex.


0.2.1     2011-01-11 10:14:42 Pacific/Auckland

        Fix a minor issue where v-strings were rejected because
        we thought they were ascii. Thanks to Torsten Veller for reporting.

0.2.0     2011-01-10 11:26:45 Pacific/Auckland

        Managed to accidentally sneak the last one out without the dep on version.pm.
        Redid the whole version split->lint-tidyup chain w/ Vincent Pits code. (Thanks VPIT)

0.001.000 2011-01-10 08:24:56 Pacific/Auckland

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
